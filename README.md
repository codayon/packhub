## 🚀 Install Linux Packages Directly from GitHub!
PackHub dynamically creates virtual Linux package repositories (`apt`, `dnf`, `yum`, etc.) on the fly, pulling directly from GitHub Releases. No need for centralized repositories—just seamless installations.

> [!TIP]
> This project is powered by github 🌟s. Go ahead and star it please! 

## ✨ Features

- **Decentralized Package Management** – Install packages directly from GitHub Releases.
- **Seamless Updates** – Automatically fetches the latest releases and updates your package manager.
- **Smart Versioning** – Detects your system version and selects the most compatible package.
- **Developer Freedom** – No need to maintain separate repositories or rely on a maintainer.
- **User Empowerment** – Get the apps you need instantly, without waiting for repositories or manual downloads.

## 🚀 Usage

To install Linux packages from a GitHub repository using PackHub, the repository must have published Linux packages in its Releases. You'll also need to set up the PackHub repository in your system's package manager.

Replace `OWNER` with the repository owner's name and `REPO` with the repository name. For example, for `https://github.com/sindresorhus/caprine`, use `sindresorhus` as `OWNER` and `caprine` as `REPO`.

If you're unsure, visit [packhub.dev](https://packhub.dev) to generate the correct command for your repository.

### Ubuntu-Based Distributions
```bash
wget -qO- http://packhub.dev/sh/ubuntu/github/OWNER/REPO | sh
```

### Debian-Based Distributions
```bash
wget -qO- http://packhub.dev/sh/debian/github/OWNER/REPO | sh
```

### RPM-Based Distributions (Fedora, openSUSE, etc.)
```bash
wget -qO- http://packhub.dev/sh/rpm/github/OWNER/REPO | sh
```

Once the PackHub repository is set up, you can install packages using your system’s package manager (`apt`, `dnf`, `yum`, etc.).
